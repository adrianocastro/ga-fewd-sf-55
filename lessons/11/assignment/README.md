# FEWD Assignment #9: Ice-Cream Maker

## Description

Using the [starter code](starter_code/) provided, implement the Ice Cream ordering system [demoed in the solution file](solution/index.html).

---

## Real-World Applications

- Use jQuery to query the HTML/DOM tree
- Use CSS to style pages
- Keep the behavior (JS) and presentation (CSS) layers separate

---

## Technical Requirements 

- Use jQuery hosted locally
- Use advanced selectors to select and style elements on the page
- Keep the JavaScript and CSS separate by making the layout changes using CSS and leveraging classes/IDs instead of directly manipulating the styles using JavaScript

## Bonus

- Use advanced selectors to target list of flavors and scoops
- Use buttons for flavors and scoops and leverage `disable` attribute to mark an inactive button
- Use `data-*` attribute to store/read label
- Use anonymous function expressions as arguments for the click handlers
