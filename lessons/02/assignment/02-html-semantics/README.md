# FEWD Assignment #2: HTML Semantics Research

## Description

Being a good developer isn’t just about knowing software development fundamentals; it’s also critical to be a good researcher. You’ll use that skill when learning a new technology or if you’re stuck with a problem or error message, but you’ll also find yourself researching less obvious information about things you already know.

From documentation, specs and manuals to forums, Q&As and blogs, there’s a whole plethora of tools available to you.

Brush up your search skills and see how quickly you can find the answers to these questions by researching solutions. Add as much detail as you can and feel free to add code examples.
