# FEWD Assignment #1: HTML Basics

## Description

For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects for Joe Johnson, freelance web developer. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another.

Your 'About Page' should describe the client’s mission and value proposition and the 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter_code/images) with descriptions of the work completed for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix.

We've provided you with [some sample copy](starter_code/sample_copy.txt) that you can use as well as [sample images](starter_code/images) for the projects.

## Evaluation / Submission

Students will create a new repository on GitHub called `ga-fewd-sf-55` and push their code to this new repository when they are ready to submit.

The following folder structure is suggested:

    .
    ├── assignments              # folder containing all homework assignments
    │   ├── 01-html-basics       # numbered assignment with identifying topic
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2).
