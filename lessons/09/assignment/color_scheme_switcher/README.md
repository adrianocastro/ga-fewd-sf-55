# FEWD Assignment #9: Color Scheme Switcher

## Description

Using the [starter code](starter_code/) provided, implement the color scheme switching as [demoed in the solution file](solution/index.html).

---

## Real-World Applications

- Use jQuery to query the HTML/DOM tree
- Use CSS to style pages
- Keep the behavior (JS) and presentation (CSS) layers separate

---

## Technical Requirements 

- Use jQuery hosted locally
- Use IDs and classes to select and style elements on the page
- The cursor should change to a pointer when mouse is over the switcher buttons
- Keep the JavaScript and CSS separate by making the layout changes using CSS and leveraging classes/IDs instead of directly manipulating the styles using JavaScript


### Bonus

- Create two different stylesheets to implement the dark and light themes and use JavaScript to swap those stylesheets instead of using classes/IDs
