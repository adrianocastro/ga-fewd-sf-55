# FEWD Assignment #4: CSS Layout

## Description

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. You will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site.

They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating.

There is no starter template provided. You can use the [HTML template](/resources/code/html_template.html) shared previously or leverage the work you did for the Relaxr homepage.

As usual, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with specs and copy](design_mocks/copy_and_specs.txt) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life.

See below for the full design mocks.

Submit the finished version for homework.

## Technical Requirements 

- Use `normalize.css` to normalize the rendering of your page across different browsers
- Use IDs and classes to select and style elements on the page
- Link the homepage you built in the previous assignment via the Relarx in the blog mock
- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the [design file](design_mocks/copy_and_specs.txt) and according to the mocks provided


### Bonus
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes (`:hover`)
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes (`:first-letter`)
- Use inline-block or floats in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
- Up for a real challenge? Use ```<script>``` tags in your HTML and [read ahead](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/) to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."
